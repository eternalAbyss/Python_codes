# Element Appearing More Than 25% In Sorted Array

Given an integer array sorted in non-decreasing order, there is exactly one integer in the array that occurs more than 25% of the time, return that integer.

## Example 1

```text
Input: arr = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

## Example 2

```text
Input: arr = [1,2,2,6,6,6,6,7,10]
Output: 6
```

Constraints:

> * 1 <= arr.length <= 10<sup>4</sup>
> * 0 <= arr[i] <= 10<sup>5</sup>
